I'm Shubham Ghosal, a passionate and dedicated engineer from India, looking to revolutionize software designing. My passion for software lies with dreaming up ideas and making them come true with elegant interfaces. I take great care in the experience, architecture, and code quality of the things I build.

I am also a big fan of open-source projects and DIY's. I learned a lot from the open-source community and I love how collaboration and knowledge sharing happened through open-source.
